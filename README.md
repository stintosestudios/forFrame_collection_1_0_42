This repository is a collection of animations made with the help of my HTML 5 animation framework called forFrame. All animations use features introduced in the first release of the framework (v1.0.42).

## Future Additions

While using a current version of forFrame it is expected that I will run into shortcomings with the framework in terms of additional features that I would like to have in the framework, as well as minor mistakes. The following is a list of changes I would like to include in the next minor release of forFrame.

### New features

* Logo property for main options object

I would like to add a feature where I can just add an object that contains at least an image index, draw width, draw height, drawX, and drawY position of an image of a logo that is to be drawn on the canvas for each frame.

* Part appendRender methods.

So I have what I call appendRender methods for scene.play, and scene.toPNGCollection. However it would be nice to have such methods as an option in place of an image so I can skin a part by way of javascript when doing so is called for.

### Bug's to fix

Adding static x, and y values for parts should work.
